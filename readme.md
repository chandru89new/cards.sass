## Cards for Humanity
a.k.a `cards.sass`

#### What's it?
Easy-to-use card UI for your app / project / website design.

[Here are some examples](http://druchan.com/cards.sass).

#### Updates

*6th Feb 2018:*  
Added two more variables:
- `$boxShadow` to control the box shadow of cards
- `$cardTitleLineHeight` and `$cardTextLineHeight` to control the line-height of title and text in cards more easily

#### How to use this?

1. Import `cards.css` or `cards.sass` (if you use a build environment that compiles sass) into your project.
2. Copy the HTML markup for any type of a card that you want (you can [find all the types here](http://druchan.com/cards.sass)).
3. Save time. Or tinker with the `cards.sass` file to customize your cards as much as you want.
